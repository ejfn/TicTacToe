## Game Logic

The game follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules:

- Players take turns placing X or O on a 3x3 grid
- First player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ejfn/TicTacToe.git
   cd TicTacToe
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo development server

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Run on a specific platform
   ```bash
   npm run android  # For Android
   npm run ios      # For iOS
   npm run web      # For web browser
   ```

## Deployment

The web version is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy updates:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for game logic and components:

```bash
npm test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Game logic functions (winner detection, board state, player moves)
- Component rendering and interactions
- Edge cases and game flow

## Design Choices

- **Theme Support**: The app includes both light and dark themes that can be toggled with a single tap
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks wins for both X and O players, as well as draws
- **Player Alternation**: The starting player alternates after each game to ensure fairness
- **Custom Markers**: Custom-designed X and O markers with animations for improved visual appeal
- **Responsive Layout**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes and platforms
- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase runs on iOS, Android, and Web browsers
- **Modern Architecture**: Uses TypeScript, React Hooks, and component-based design
